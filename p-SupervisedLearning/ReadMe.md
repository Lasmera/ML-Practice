# Overview
---

In this section you will learn how to design and select features, as well as select values for model hyperparameters.
Get acquainted with industrial solutions in the field of machine learning such as **XGBoost** and **CatBoost**.
Here we take a closer look at the work with the "_Scikit-learn_" library and get acquainted with the machine learning algorithms it provides, such as:
1. _k-neighbors_
1. _Linear SVM_
1. _Naive bayes_
1. _Decision trees_
1. _Random forest_
1. _Neural networks_
1. _Logistic regression_
