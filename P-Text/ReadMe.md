In this section, you will learn how to train a model that determines whether an expression is positive or negative.

In the process of achieving this goal, you will learn about the following things:
1. Preprocessing of data.
1. The use of stop words.
1. Converting text to numeric characters (vectorization). In this case, you will get acquainted with the algorithms:
  1. Bag of words (BoW)
  1. TF-IDF
  1. word2vec
1. Confusion matrix
1. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)
