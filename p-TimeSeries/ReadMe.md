# Overview

In this section you will learn how to build a model based on **time series**.
On the way to this goal, we will consider the following things:
1. **Autoregression**, in particular, we will use the **autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)** model.
1. The **stabilization** of the **dispersion**.
1. **Stationarity**.
1. Using of **Random forest** and **Linear regression models**
